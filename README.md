# LCP (Lanzoor Command Panel)

> Hello! Welcome to the LCP help page. Make sure to read all of this file, to download and furthermore run the Lanzoor Command Panel properly.

## Installing the Python Interpreter

Sorry for the inconvenience, but for now, Lanzoor Command Panel needs a **Python interpreter** to run successfully. If you already installed the Python interpreter, you can skip this step.

1. Start by installing the **Python interpreter** by clicking [here](https://python.org/downloads).
2. Click the **[Download Python]** button. It will install an executable file for you.
3. Follow all instructions that the installation wizard says.

> NOTE: Make sure to download the **latest version** of Python! You need to download at least **3.10~** version of Python otherwise some features might not work properly!

If you are done downloading the Python interpreter. You can proceed downloading the Lanzoor Command Panel itself.

## Installing Lanzoor Command Panel

Download the latest version of Lanzoor Command Panel by clicking [here](https://github.com/Lanzoor/Lanzoor-Command-Panel/releases/latest). Make sure to download the ZIP file. Now, unzip the ZIP file that you downloaded. It will contain those files: **README.md** which is the current file that you are viewing, **functions.py** python file which is a file that contains functions for the actual program itself which is the **main.py**.

> NOTE: If you are going to download individual files, make sure to download both **functions.py** file and the **main.py** file. Otherwise the code just will not work.

If you are done installing those files or the ZIP file, double click on the **main.py** file. It will show you a pop up, saying to choose which app/program to open this file with; click the option **Python**.

> NOTE: If you are on MacOS, because an outdated version of Python Interpreter is installed by default, make sure to select the new one. You can check those by looking their names carefully.

It will now open up the terminal, which is the Lanzoor Command Panel itself.
