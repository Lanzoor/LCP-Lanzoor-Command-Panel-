# LCP (Lanzoor Command Panel)

LCP is a simple command terminal program that was built by Lanzoor using pure python.

## How to run LCP

1. Install Python.

Install python by clicking [here](https://python.org/downloads), follow the instructions that the python installation wizard says, and finish the installation!

2. Install LCP.

Install the ZIP file of the latest release of LCP by clicking [here](https://github.com/Lanzoor/Lanzoor-Command-Panel/releases/tag/LCPUpdatesBeta1.1.4), and then unzip it.
Left click the `main.py` file. It will show you what app to open it, and choose python.
Now, it will open the terminal!

(Also if you decide to download the individual files, it is important to get both `functions.py` and `main.py` file. Otherwise the code won't work!)
